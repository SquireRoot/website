        It may take me a long time to get things done but just know that my lack of action 
        on this site is not at all correlated with my appreciation of your gift. The gift
        of this domain and the site you made for it meant more to me than I could convey.
        It truly is one of the best (if not the best) gifts I have ever received. Nobody
        has every given me a gift that was so personalized or directed at myself and I honestly
        think about this site regularly. It pains me to think that I haven't put anything
        up here until now.
    </p>

        I always knew I would build a site to put on this domain but if I'm honest I didn't
        know where to start. I know you say that this web stuff is easy and that anyone
        could do it but I really do think you're selling yourself short. There is a reason
        they pay you the big bucks at Adobe and this shitty site should show you why. To start,
        I didn't even know how to get off the ground. Unlike C++ and other engineering I
        have done where the path is clear to me, there are SOOO many javascript frameworks
        and web tools that to say it's overwhelming is an understatment. I don't know what an
        angular is but it sounds like some fancy protractor that a drunk carpenter made
        and I'm not sure how that relates to websites. To give you some perspective, it took
        me way longer than I would like to admit to figure out how to separate these text 
        chunks into rendered paragraphs, but I'm learning.

    <p>
        Like any other type of engineering problem I have tried to solve, I decided to keep
        it simple and start from here. I learned what a static site is and fiddled around with
        some style tags and here we are. I'm trying to learn new tools and expand my software
        engineering skills. I feel like I have been on an island of comfort for too long 
        in C++ land and its time to learn new tools. Javascript seems cool but its gonna take
        me a long time to trust a language that thinks "1"==1 is true. I suppose I'm already
        somewhat familiar with React as thats what I do when cppreference tells me "Care should
        be taken when using enable_if in the type of a template non-type parameter of a 
        namespace-scope function template" 
        <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/enable_if">(link cause I know how to do that now)</a>.
        Webdev can't be that bad right? right??

        Anyways, just know I love you and that our friendship means the world to me. I hope all 
        is well with you out in San Jose and that Cameroun and the Sauce are doing well too.
        Can't wait for you to come visit in March for Spader and Abi's wedding

    Best,<br>
